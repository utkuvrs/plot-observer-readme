## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Plot Observer is an iOS and Android hybrid application developed using Flutter and Dart. It's purpose is to quickly scan the high amounts of vehicles inside parking lots to be able to effectively and efficiently create tickets for the vehicles that are causing parking violations.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Coding Style

Dart is a very simple and straight forward programming language inspired by TypeScript and C.

[Effective Dart: Style](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style)

Understanding Flutter's Widgets and how they are shown to the UI might be a little confusing but with practice it'll fit in.

[Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/learn-flutter)

## üíª Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### üñ∂ Printer

- Printer business layer is separated to two components. Zebra Programming Language (ZPL) Service and Zebra Printer Service.
- Zebra printers act as BLE Peripherals so the Flutter application must act as a BLE Central. You can use [this](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_blue_plus) package to connect & send commands to the Zebra Printer.
- On iOS, apps can only access devices they have connected to in the current session.

1. [Zebra Printer Service](lib/services/zebra_service.dart)
2. [ZPL Service](lib/services/zpl_service.dart)

### üé• Scanner

Scanner uses `ResolutionPreset.medium`, using anything higher than this can cause lag and even crashes.

There is a certain delay manually applied to the scanner logic to make sure that the `CameraPreview` doesn't freeze but continues without making the necessary operations too many times.

To be able to apply OCR to the taken image we need to convert the `CameraImage` (package:camera) instance to different formats depending on the platform that the application is running on. For more details please see [Camera Service](lib/services/camera_service.dart)
